## Building

1) Download the SDL2 development headers and sling them into a folder called `msvc_libs`
2) Copy `7z.exe` and `7z.dll` from a 7z installation to the utilities folder
3) Have Visual Studio installed; you'll need to edit make.bat if you want to use a version other than 2017
4) Run make.bat
